# SMS Decryption Task

Here's your first task!

During the investigation of the incident at the Christmas workshop, we discovered something strange. One of the messaging systems that sends alerts to the emergency guards for the workshop has sent an SMS to an unknown number. Unfortunately, the message is completely unreadable to us, so we need your mobile detective skills. Once you figure it out, send me your answer in the format PST{your answer here}.
